# Deep Learning A-Z 2025: Neural Networks, AI


These are my personal learning notes and personal experiments conducted while going through the course [Deep Learning A-Z 2025: Neural Networks, AI](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) on Udemy, along with additional advanced material I explored to deepen my understanding.

**Supervised Learning**:

- [**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**](./01_Artificial_Neural_Networks_ANNs/ANN.ipynb)\
  **ANNs** are the foundation of Deep Learning, capable of solving regression and classification problems by mimicking the way biological neurons process information.

- [**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**](./02_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs/CNN.ipynb)\
  **CNNs** specialize in processing visual data, enabling tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

- [**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**](./03_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_RNNs/RNN.ipynb)\
  **RNN** is a type of neural network designed for sequential data processing, where connections between nodes allow information to persist across time steps, making it useful for tasks like time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.


**Unsupervised Learning**:

- [**Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**](./04_Self_Organizing_Maps_SOMs/SOM.ipynb)\
  **SOM** is an unsupervised neural network used for dimensionality reduction and clustering. It maps high-dimensional data onto a 2D grid while preserving topological relationships, making it useful for data visualization, pattern recognition, and customer segmentation.
